==================

Meta search engine using duckduckgo bangs and startpage as a default.  

By default search queries will be sent to [Startpage](https://startpage.com), not DuckDuckGo.  

The [bang syntax](http://duckduckgo.com/bang.html) is handled by DuckDuckGo, except C<!>, which will get you the first Google result, instead of the first DuckDuckGo result.
